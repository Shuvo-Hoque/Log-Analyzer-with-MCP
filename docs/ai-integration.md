# AI Integration Guide

## 🖥️ Claude Desktop Integration

You can add the configuration for the MCP server in Claude for Desktop for AI-assisted log analysis.

To get Claude for Desktop and how to add an MCP server, access [this link](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user). Add this to your respective json file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cw-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/Log-Analyzer-with-MCP/src/cw-mcp-server",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  },
}
```

If you're running into issues, check out the [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) or open a GitHub Issue. 

## 🔍 AI Assistant Capabilities

With the enhanced tool support, AI assistants can now:

1. **Discover Log Groups**:
   - "Show me all my CloudWatch log groups"
   - "List log groups that start with /aws/lambda"
   - "Show me the next page of log groups"

2. **Understand Log Structure**:
   - "Analyze the structure of my API Gateway logs"
   - "What fields are common in these JSON logs?"
   - "Show me a sample of recent logs from this group"

3. **Diagnose Issues**:
   - "Find all errors in my Lambda logs from the past 24 hours"
   - "What's the most common error pattern in this log group?"
   - "Show me logs around the time this service crashed"

4. **Perform Analysis**:
   - "Compare log volumes between these three services"
   - "Find correlations between errors in my database and API logs"
   - "Analyze the trend of timeouts in my Lambda function"

>If you want to use different aws profile, just mention the profile name with your prompt - `"Show me all my CloudWatch log groups using <profile_name> profile"`

## 💬 AI Prompt Templates

The server provides specialized prompts that AI assistants can use:

1. **List and Explore Log Groups Prompt**:

   I'll help you explore the CloudWatch log groups in your AWS environment.
   First, I'll list the available log groups...
   ```

2. **Log Analysis Prompt**:
